# Nigeria-Banking-SEO-Visibility-Analysis
SEO visibility and search performance analysis of selected Nigerian consumer banks using keyword rankings, visibility scores, and revenue comparison.

## Project Background

The Nigerian consumer banking sector is highly competitive, with major banks competing for visibility across digital channels, particularly search engines. As customers increasingly rely on online search to compare banking services, SEO performance has become a key driver of brand visibility and customer acquisition.

This project analyzes search visibility and keyword performance for a selected group of 10 major Nigerian banks, using a curated dataset of 50 consumer banking–related keywords. The goal is to understand how banks perform in organic search, how visibility is distributed across competitors, and whether stronger SEO presence aligns with higher revenue levels.

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:

- **SEO Visibility Performance**: Evaluation of total visibility scores and ranking strength across banks to identify market leaders and laggards.
- **Keyword Coverage & Ranking Depth:** Analysis of how many keywords each bank ranks for and their relative positioning in search results.
- **Search Demand Analysis:** Identification of the highest-volume banking keywords driving consumer interest.
- **SEO Visibility vs Revenue:** Exploratory assessment of the relationship between search visibility and reported bank revenue.
